# Task3_BasicCalculator
The challenge was to create a calculator program that takes in an operator and two integers and does the respective math operation based on the presented input.

We begin the program by creating a class to house our calculator program. In the class we define a function called calculate that has 3 parameters, two integer parameters and a string parameter for the operator. For the calculator program we'll use a switch statement which based on the operator input will switch to the respective case. Once it switches to the case we pass the 2 integer parameters to do the math opration. But also we added an error for division by zero and when we have a case where we have an invalid operator.

we finish by presenting test cases with different operators and error cases minorfor the function, to test it's functionality.
We print all the respective tests to complete the program.
